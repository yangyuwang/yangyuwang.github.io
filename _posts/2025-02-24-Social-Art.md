This is a large project, including artist network analysis, painting style prediction, and artist agent construction (deep learning/GenAI), by utilizing the historical painting data on [WikiArt.org](https://www.wikiart.org/).

For now, a latest version of artist network analysis could be found [here](https://wangyd.shinyapps.io/wikiart_network/).
